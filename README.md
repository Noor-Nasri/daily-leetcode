# daily-leetcode

Now that I have graduated and entered the work-force, I want to ensure I am still learning and staying sharp. I haven't done any competitive programming since first-year, when I set a campus record by competing at the ICPC North American Championships. The goal of this repo is to do about an hour of leetcode every day for the next year, which will help me get my edge back while reviving my old github. 

If I am able to stay consistent with this goal, it would make for a pretty nice widget on a personal site.
